A visually appealing landing page that displays the soccer team Barcelona FC's next game data in my current time-zone, fetched from their website at https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/, so that I no longer need to look up game times.

This project was a personal test of my vanilla JS web skills and includes fetching data using puppeteer to get dynamic data from the web, and a completely vanilla implementation of a complex dark mode toggle animation


## Installation

Install the packages and run the project using:

```bash
npm install
node scraper.js
```
